collection.pdf

 3. Mark Sweep method -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na%C3%AFve_mark-and-sweep

1. Reference Counting method

2. Mark and Sweep method (mark all the nodes of the tree using constant space (i.e. without
using either recursion or a stack)

II. For the garbage nodes, implement the merge memory technique of free space management
and make sure that the adjacent blocks are merged together. Display the size of the freed and
merged memory in terms of bytes.
III. Upload your complete code to the github repository that you created in assignment 2 and
provide the link in gradescope.
